"""M8 integration — the "compile once, run on N datasets" deployment pattern, end to end.

A realistic multi-observable analysis is compiled ONCE to an optimized, interned ``DurablePlan``
(``deployment.compile_plan``) and re-targeted at several synthetic datasets via
``DurablePlan.for_dataset``, all sharing ONE checkpoint ``Store``. These tests exercise the pattern
for **correctness** (per-dataset bit-for-bit, partition-count invariance), **responsiveness**
(kill mid-deployment then resume, skipping completed work; a finished deployment redoes nothing),
and **usability/performance** (one compiled artifact reused across datasets; retargeting is cheap and
content-addressing namespaces datasets in a single store). It is the regression guard for the whole
deployment story.
