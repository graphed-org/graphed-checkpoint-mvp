"""Retry / recovery policies for failed partitions (plan M8).

When ``process(partition, resources)`` raises, the runner asks a policy to recover. A policy returns
the partial result if it can recover, or re-raises (the runner then dead-letters the partition).
Policies (plan M8 targets): ``retry_n | retry_smaller_chunk | retry_elsewhere | quarantine``.

``RetrySmallerChunk`` is the one with teeth: it splits the partition into sub-ranges and processes
each (recursively, down to ``min_size``), combining the sub-results — so a chunk that OOMed whole
**succeeds split** (the M8 acceptance: "``retry_smaller_chunk`` succeeds where the original OOMed").
